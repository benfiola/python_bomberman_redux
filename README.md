# Python Bomberman
## Introduction
In a nutshell, I'm implementing [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman) in Python.

This is something I've been working on for quite a while, through several iterations and general re-designs.  The basic premise is simple enough, but I think I'm viewing this project as a sandbox in which I can try different design approaches and technologies/libraries in lieu of a project where I'm racing to reach an end-goal.

With that being said, it's likely I'll never finish this thing, but I'm really curious to see what cool stuff I can glean from the overall experience.
